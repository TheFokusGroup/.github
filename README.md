# TheFokusGroup.

Designing the future of intentional productivity.
TheFokusGroup is an internal product studio dedicated to building tools that prioritize human focus over feature bloat. We believe that software should be invisible, enabling users to reach a state of flow without the friction of complex interfaces.

Human Design meets bulletproofed code.
